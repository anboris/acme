app â€“ wrap acme in a macOS .app bundle

app bundles a running-acme script into Acme.app so you can keep
acme in the Dock.  Run mk; the bundle appears in the current
directory.  Nothing else to configure.

This code is taken (touched only to simplify) from
https://github.com/lufia/acmeedit for ease of use and safekeeping.
