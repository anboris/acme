gg â€“ tiny git-grep wrapper that always speaks Acme

gg runs git-grep(1) from the root of the current Git repository and
rewrites every file name so it is relative to the directory in which
gg is executed.  The output is a sequence of lines of the form

	path:line:text

suitable for middle-clicking in an Acme window.  If standard input
is a pipe (as when Acme runs Edit . >gg) the pattern is read from
the first line of standard input; otherwise the pattern is taken
from the first argument.  No other options are accepted; all git-grep
selection is done with the default set of tracked files.

gg exits immediately with status 0 if any matches are found, 1 if
none are found, and 2 on error.
