ix is a tiny helper for Acme that opens or creates a .index file
for the current project or directory. The index file is intended
as a lightweight, personal scratch space to keep quick notes, paths,
and thoughts tied to the current work.

Inside a Git repository it uses the repo root, in the home directory
it uses ~/.index, and otherwise it uses the current directory. With
-g it always opens the global index in ~/.index.

The -l flag lists all .index files under the home directory relative
to the current directory for reference.

It requires plan9port, the plumber daemon running, and plumb in
your $PATH.
