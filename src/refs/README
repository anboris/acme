refs is a small Go utility designed to bridge the environment context
gap when executing acme-lsp's L refs command from outside the main
Acme process, such as via skhd.

When the L refs command is executed by an external process (like
rc -c triggered by skhd), the Current Working Directory (CWD) is
often the root (/) instead of the directory of the file in the
active Acme window. This causes acme-lsp to generate incorrect or
poorly resolved file paths.

refs reads the active Acme window's tag from standard input, extracts
the full file path, changes its own process's CWD to that file's
directory, and then executes L refs in the correct context, piping
the formatted results back to standard output.

Configure skhd to read the active Acme window's tag and pipe it
into the refs utility:

	shift + cmd - r [
		"acme" : /usr/local/plan9/bin/rc -c \
			'9p read acme/`{dial unix!`{namespace}/acmefocused}/tag |\
			refs |\
			9p write acme/`{dial unix!`{namespace}/acmefocused}/errors'
	]
