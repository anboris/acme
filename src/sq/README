sq — minimal SQLite CLI helper

sq reads SQL from stdin and executes it in your project’s SQLite
database. It automatically detects the DB in the project root (common
names: app.db, main.db, data.db) or uses any *.db if none match.
Works inside git repos or standalone directories.

Use -v to show which DB is used.

Designed for Acme and terminal workflows: select SQL, pipe to sq,
and it runs in the correct DB automatically.
