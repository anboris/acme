ff â€“ tiny find wrapper that always speaks Acme

ff runs find(1) from the root of the current Git repository and
rewrites every file name so it is relative to the directory in which
ff is executed. The output is a sequence of lines of the form

	path

suitable for middle-clicking in an Acme window. If standard input
is a pipe (as when Acme runs Edit . >ff) the pattern is read from
the first line of standard input; otherwise the pattern is taken
from the first argument. No other options are accepted; ff simply
searches for files whose names begin with the given pattern.

gg exits immediately with status 0 if any matches are found, 1 if
none are found, and 2 on error.
